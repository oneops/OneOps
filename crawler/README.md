# OneOps Data Crawler (OOCrawler)

OOCrawler is a standalone Java Application which scans the OneOps data including environments, deployments, computes etc and "feeds" it to custom plugins which can do further processing as needed.
The data is processed one entity at a time - Like one environment at a time.

You can write your own plugin by extending the [AbstractCrawlerPlugin Class](src/main/java/com/oneops/crawler/AbstractCrawlerPlugin.java)
