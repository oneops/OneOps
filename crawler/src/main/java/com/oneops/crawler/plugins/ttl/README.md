# OneOps Environment TTL Crawler Plugin

This plugin processes the Environment, Platforms and Deployments data received from the CMSCrawler and then does following:

1. Checks if the Environment is a non-production environment, if yes, do following things
2. Checks if the Enviroment is dormant for long time (configurable). If yes, do following
3. Send notification using OneOps antenna that the Env will be TTLed after certain date
4. If the TTL date is up, disable platforms and do force deploy on that environment to decommission it and recover the resources 


#### Criteria for deciding if the environment can be auto-TTLed:

1. Environment Profile is non-null and does not contain "prod" (case-insensitive) in it
2. Environment is not deployed since last X days (configured using system property)
3. None of its platforms have "prod" in their active clouds.

Java system properties:

```ttl.deployed.before.days``` : TTL those Envs which are not deployed since these # of days

```ttl.plugin.enabled``` : if set to ```true```, the plugin will actually go ahead with decommissioning in an env is found eligible. If not set, it will just scan the environments

```ttl.es.enabled``` : if set to ```true```, this plugin will save all of its data to the ES instance configured 

```ttl.grace.period.days``` : The number of days the Env will be alerted for TTL before it is actually purged by this plugin
